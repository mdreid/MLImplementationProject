In main.py:
- Code to reduce sample size to 1000 for faster training/testing. The size can be changed by setting SMALL_SIZE to a different number
- I've created a smaller size dataset (1000), so you don't have to re-run it (set USE_SMALL_SIZE=1 and SMALL_SIZE=1000 is enough)
- Also, the smaller dataset is dumped to file for faster loading
- To use the full dataset, set USE_SMALL_SIZE = 0

Nearest neighbor implement is in NearestNeighborKD.py
- Call .fit to train 
- Call .predict to test
- Some notes: because the data has 784 features, which is inefficient for k-d tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree (High-dimensional data)). I implemented a shrink function to reduce the dimension of our instances (from 784 to 28), which can be turned on by setting shrink_features=1 in the fit function
