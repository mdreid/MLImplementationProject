\section{Dataset}
	The dataset that we used is the MINIST database of handwritten digits \cite{MNISTDatabase}, which is widely used in training and testing different machine learning methods. The dataset was constructed from NIST's Special Database 3 (collected among Census Bureau employees) and Special Database 1 (collected among high school students). It has pixel values (integers from 0 to 255) for 60,000 training examples and a separate testing set of 10,000 examples. Half of the training set and testing set are taken from the SD-3 and the other halves are taken from the SD-1.
