\section{Dataset}
	The dataset that we use is the MNIST database of handwritten digits \cite{MNISTDatabase}, which is widely used in training and testing different machine learning methods. The dataset was constructed from NIST's Special Database 3 (collected among Census Bureau employees) and Special Database 1 (collected among high school students). It has pixel values (integers from 0 to 255) for 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples.
