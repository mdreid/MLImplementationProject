\section{Dataset}
	The dataset that we used is the MNIST database of handwritten digits \cite{MNISTDatabase}, which is widely used in training and testing different machine learning methods. The dataset was constructed from NIST's Special Database 3 (collected among Census Bureau employees) and Special Database 1 (collected among high school students). It has pixel values (integers from 0 to 255) for 60,000 training examples and a separate testing set of 10,000 examples. Half of the training set and testing set are taken from the SD-3 and the other halves are taken from the SD-1.
	
	After obtaining the original training and testing files from MNIST website, since the features list of the MNIST dataset is in matrix form, we transform the origin training and testing sets by flattening the features list to an array.
