\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we designed an ensemble algorithm that combined decision trees with $k$-NN. This algorithm performed better than unsupplemented $k$-NN on a reduced dimensionality dataset of handwritten digits. The hybrid algorithm's performance improved with additional training instances. These results are promising and suggest that this algorithm might be useful in other learning settings.
