After running PCA, we had a set of 100 real-valued features. 
Therefore, we decided on an algorithm implementation
We implemented decision trees using Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm (cite - Quinlan).
At a high level, we grew a complete tree and then greedily pruned it.
To choose splits, we choose the split with the maximum information gain.
We prune the tree using a tuning set 10\% of the size of the training set not including these tuning examples.
For each pair of leaf nodes, we compare the accuracy of the tree on the tuning set with the pair to the accuracy of the tree on the tuning set without the pair.
If the latter is less than or equal to the former, we prune the leaves.
We repeat this pruning process recursively.
We provide data on the the size of the tree before and after pruning in the Results section.
